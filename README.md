# Overview

Hello! My name is Cayson, and this is my simple SQLite database. I built this program as a stepping
stone for me as I am working to build a client server application. This is a simple database with 2
tables that are fully editable and useable by the person running this program.

# Relational Database

In this project, I am using a simple SQLite database that has 2 tables. These tables contain information
about customers and users in a system. While not very complex, this was just a simple practice database
to help me learn for the real thing. The tables contain a primary keys that are not unique and allow for
the user of the program to create info for other users and customers.

# Development Environment

I used VS Code for this project and I programmed it all in python.
